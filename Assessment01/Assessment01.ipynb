    "\n",
    "> _Cain‚Äôs Jawbone, the bald narrative of a series of tragic happenings during a period of less than six months in a recent year, has met with an accident which seems to be unique in the history of the novelette. The pages have been printed in an entirely haphazard and incorrect order, a fact which reflects little credit on somebody. The author assures his readers, however, that while it is now too late for him to remedy the ordering of the pages, it is quite possible for them, should they care to take the trouble, to reorder them correctly for themselves. Before they attempt to do this, they may care to be assured that there is an inevitable order, the one in which the pages were written, and that, while the narrator‚Äôs mind may flit occasionally backwards and forwards in the modern manner, the narrative marches on, relentlessly and unequivocally, from the first page to the last._\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your friend has sent you this book in digital form and suggested that you might use your data science skills to crack it\n",
    "    * [There is a prize](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/23/cain-enabled-tiktok-helps-reissued-literary-puzzle-fly-off-the-shelves) for getting the pages in the correct order and giving the full names of the six persons murdered and the full names of their murderers\n",
    "    * You decide to have a go using your command-line powers to solve the mystery (i.e., get the pages in the right order and identify the murderers) \n",
    "* Questions 1-4 are all about analysing this text\n",
    "* Question 5 is about the ethics of Airbnb's use of data\n",
    "* Question 6 is about correctly preparing and submitting this Assessment"

Both their sections and stanzas follow the same **rhyming scheme** (all-Hall, light-tonight). Some other pages and their poems/quotations also have similar rhyming schemes, however pages 41 and 93 are particularly interesting as they reference the same character or subject (**M‚ÄôCullough**). Because of this, there is substantial evidence to believe that these poems/quotations are connected and therefore consecutive."

While Airbnb might only be interested in making use of their own customers' data, the technological capabilities of this algorithm introduce the danger of **harmful misuse of data**. For example, the algorithm may be utilised to background check people irrelevant to Airbnb's business activities without their consent, which is a **major breach in privacy**. It may incentivise online criminals to access this algorithm. Furthermore, as Airbnb is a major name in global consumerism both in the travel market and in general, this may push the use of **similar algorithms toward other companies**. Both direct and indirect competitors may take inspiration from Airbnb and develop their own algorithms by which to background check their own customers within their own market. Similar to how it may affect the platform's existing users, the algorithm is a **major breach in ethical use of consumer data**. Not only is it seemingly being used without proper consumer **consent**, the algorithm is known to blindside or **discriminate certain groups** (such as sex workers) without **promoting values of transparency** towards those groups. Thus, external communities that may not be direct customers of Airbnb may be affected by the potential of growing use of algorithmic decision making in other markets, which may damage their online reputation for what are otherwise harmless acts of online expression.\n",

    "> One such ethically significant harm of data practice that Vallor mentions is the harm to privacy & security. As mentioned within the [CHOICE article](https://www.choice.com.au/consumers-and-data/data-collection-and-use/how-your-data-is-used/articles/Airbnb-banning-users) as well as directly in [Airbnb's Privacy Policy](https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/3175/privacy-policy), they make use of certain third-party services in order to background check their own customers in the formation of their 'trustworthiness algorithm'. While the accessibility of their privacy and anti-discrimination policies may imply *some* sort of transparency in data practice, the article still shows that this is not enough. The data to create this algorithm is not collected through enough **informed consent**, with the users not having enough **autonomy** or control over exactly how much of their personal data is used. This already in itself causes internal reputational harm between the user and Airbnb, with the company preferring to serve customers with 'higher trustworthiness'. Lastly, the **data used may not stay confined to the digital context it was originally shared**. A user may have in the past made a post about something in jest or with a human-detectable level of sarcasm, yet the algorithm may not detect it that way and instead paints a harmless joke as a potential danger to Airbnb's reputation should that customer interact with their business. This is not only plain unfair, but also **ethically unjustifiably intrusive and harmful from a data practice perspective**.\n",

    "> One of the general ethical frameworks that Vallor presents is **consequentialist/utilitarian ethics**. This framework of ethics is based around the principle of the **greatest good**, in which we decide on actions based on which would result in the **greatest net sum of good (pleasure) for not only an individual but a group of people**. We can apply this way of thinking to Airbnb's trustworthiness algorithm. We can see from the [CHOICE article](https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/3175/privacy-policy) that this algorithm mostly positively affects Airbnb, but does not take into consideration the greater consumer base. Airbnb seems to be acting **within their own interests** failing to adequately market research whether their customers and other relevant stakeholders may be interested being subject to such an algorithm. Current customers that are deemed to be trustworthy by the algorithm may not be subject to a major change, possibly only a **minor gain** in positive experiences with hosts/guests. Those deemed to be untrustworthy however is then **completely blocked** from interacting whatsoever with Airbnb as a service. While this may not be a major subsect of Airbnb's consumer base, we have to ask ourselves whether or not the complete ban of these 'untrustworthy' customers is an **adequate exchange** for a minor gain for the rest of the consumer base. In other words, is there **a net sum of good** for the consumer base and other relevant stakeholders for Airbnb as a business?\n"
